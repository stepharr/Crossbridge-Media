        <h4>Crossbridge Church </h4>
        <p>Crossbridge began with a group of people began to talk about a new church in the Sugar Land/SW Houston area. The longing was to have a church focused on Jesus Christ as revealed in the scriptures, build true community and attract the over-churched and un-churched.
September 2002 saw our first public service at Sartartia Middle School. The church was comprised of a young 18-35 crowd. The church quickly grew to 200 people, with a thriving Children’s Ministry, and a second service was added in 2006 a second service was added. The church from the beginning focused on building community, through small groups meeting throughout the week and living on mission through various service projects and outreach events.

During our brief history, we’ve built strong friendships, grown in our understanding and application of the Gospel. We have seen lives changed through the power of the Gospel of Jesus Christ; people becoming Christians who thought the Bible was myth, marriage being healed and restored, and people growing in their compassion and generosity. The years of challenges and accomplishments has reminded us that what we truly desire is to see lives changed by the Gospel – we as individuals, our church, our community and world.

In the fall of 2007 we began negotiations to lease 15,000 square feet on Eldridge Blvd in Sugar Land. We signed and the lease and began retrofitting the facility in late 2008 and are looking forward to moving in early 2009. The building will be seen as a mission base to train Christians to live as sent by God to love and lead their world to know Jesus. The building is not our church, we are the church. Our vision is to see the building used to “make growing followers of Jesus Christ”. We look forward to our next chapter as God grows us.</p>

        <h4>Our Mission… To Honor God by making growing followers of Jesus Christ.</h4>
        <p>Our ultimate purpose is to bring honor and glory to God (1 Corinthians 10:31). We do this as a church community by being about the mission that Jesus left His church; to make disciples (Matthew 28:16-20). A disciple is a follower of Jesus Christ. Becoming a follower of Jesus is an event and a process. The event is salvation and the process is called sanctification. One becomes a follower of Jesus when they place their faith in the death and resurrection of the Lord Jesus Christ, this is salvation. The rest of the Christian life is a journey of becoming more like Jesus in our character (thoughts and actions) which is called sanctification.

This process of becoming a Christ-Follower and growing as one only happens authentically through the Gospel of Jesus Christ. You can become religious and moral, but the kind of transformation that allows a person to have a right relationship with God the Father is through the Gospel of Jesus Christ.</p>
